# Apollo Type Guards

This binary lets you enhance types generated by Apollo CLI by creating type guards associated with it.

## Install

With npm:
```sh
npm install --save-dev apollo-type-guards
```

With yarn:
```sh
yarn add --dev apollo-type-guards
```

## Usage

- Run `apollo client:codegen` CLI to generate types files from your schema
- Run  
  ```
  apollo-type-guards --globDir="glob/to/generated/folders"
  ```
- Depending on you folder structure you should see something like this:  
  Before :
  ```
  .
  └── src
      └── __generated__
          ├── QueryOne.ts
          └── QueryTwo.ts
  ```
  After:
  ```
  .
  └── src
      └── __generated__
          ├── guards
          │   ├── QueryOne.ts
          │   └── QueryTwo.ts
          ├── QueryOne.ts
          └── QueryTwo.ts
  ```
